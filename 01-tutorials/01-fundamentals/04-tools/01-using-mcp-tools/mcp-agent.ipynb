    "## Overview\n",
    "The [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) is an open protocol that standardizes how applications provide context to Large Language Models (LLMs). Strands AI SDK integrates with MCP to extend agent capabilities through external tools and services.\n",
    "\n",
    "MCP enables communication between agents and MCP servers that provide additional tools. The Strands Agent SDK includes built-in support for connecting to MCP servers and using their tools.\n",

We will use the [AWS Documentation MCP server](https://awslabs.github.io/mcp/servers/aws-documentation-mcp-server/) which provides tools to access AWS documentation, search for content, and get recommendations. This MCP server has 3 main features:\n",

    "### Connect to MCP server using stdio transport\n",
    "\n",
    "[Transposts](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-03-26/basic/transports) in MCP provide the foundations for communication between clients and servers. It handles the underlying mechanics of how messages are sent and received. At the moment there are two standards transport implementations built-in in MCP:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Standard Input/Output (stdio)**: enables communication through standard input and output streams. It is particulary useful for local integrations and command-line tools\n",
    "- **Streamable HTTP**: this replaces the HTTP+SSSE transport from previous protocol version. In the Streamable HTTP transport, the server operates as an independent process that can handle multiple client connections. This transport uses HTTP POST and GET requests. Server can optionally make use of Server-Sent Events (SSE) to stream multiple server messages. This permits basic MCP servers, as well as more feature-rich servers supporting streaming and server-to-client notifications and requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, you should use stdio for building command-line tools, implementing local integrations and working with shell scripts. You should use Streamable HTTP transports when you need a flexible and efficient way for AI agents to communicate with tools and services, especially when dealing with stateless communication or when minimizing resource usage is crucial.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also use custom transports implementation for your specific needs. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's now connect to the MCP server using stdio transport. First of all, we will use the class `MCPClient` to connect to the [AWS Documentation MCP Server](https://awslabs.github.io/mcp/servers/aws-documentation-mcp-server/).
