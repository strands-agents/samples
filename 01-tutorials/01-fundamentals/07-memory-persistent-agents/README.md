# 07 - Memory & Persistent Agents

This tutorial demonstrates how to build Strands Agents that can remember information across multiple interactions by leveraging persistent memory. 

## Key Concepts

- **Agent Memory:** Allows the agent to store and recall information from previous turns.
- **Use Cases:** Personal assistants, customer support bots, and any scenario where context continuity is valuable.

## Usage

1. **Notebook**: Go through the notebook to understand the concept of memory and its implementation using Strands-tools. 
2. [Optional] To have an interactive chat, follow these steps to run the script in this folder:

    a. Install the requirements using `pip install -r requirements.txt` 
  
    b. Run the python script using `python personal_agent_with_memory.py` and interact with the agent by asking questions or giving it information.

    Task: Observe how the agent remembers facts or context from earlier in the conversation, even after restarting.
