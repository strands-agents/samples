    "Multi-agent systems consist of multiple autonomous agents collaborating to solve complex problems through task distribution, specialization, and parallel processing.\n",

    "By the end of this notebook, you'll understand how to:\n",
    "- Create different multi-agent topologies (star, mesh, hierarchical)\n",
    "- Send messages between agents\n",
    "- Monitor agent interactions\n",
    "- Design specialized agent networks for different use cases\n",
