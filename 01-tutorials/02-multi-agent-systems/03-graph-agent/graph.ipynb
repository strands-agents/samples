    "By the end of this notebook, you'll be able to:\n",
    "- Understand the three core components of agent graphs (nodes, edges, topologies)\n",
    "- Create and manage different topology patterns (star, mesh, hierarchical)\n",
    "- Implement both natural language and structured approaches to agent graphs\n",
    "- Send targeted messages between specific agents\n",
    "- Monitor and control multi-agent networks\n",
    "- Design specialized agent systems for real-world scenarios\n",

    "## Understanding Agent Graph Components\n",
    "An agent graph is a structured network of interconnected AI agents designed to solve complex problems through coordinated collaboration. Each agent represents a specialized node with specific capabilities, and the connections between agents define explicit communication pathways.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we start building, let's understand the three primary components of an agent graph:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Nodes (Agents)\n",
    "Each node represents an AI agent with:\n",
    "- **Identity**: Unique identifier within the graph\n",
    "- **Role**: Specialized function or purpose\n",
    "- **System Prompt**: Instructions defining the agent's behavior\n",
    "- **Tools**: Capabilities available to the agent\n",
    "- **Message Queue**: Buffer for incoming communications\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Edges (Connections)\n",
    "Edges define communication pathways with:\n",
    "- **Direction**: One-way or bidirectional information flow\n",
    "- **Relationship**: How agents relate (supervisor/worker, peer-to-peer)\n",
    "- **Message Passing**: Mechanism for transferring information\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Topology Patterns\n",
    "Different network structures for different use cases:\n",
    "- **Star**: A central coordinator with radiating specialists, ideal for centralized workflows like content creation with editorial oversight or customer service with escalation paths.\n",
    "- **Mesh**: Fully connected network where all agents can communicate directly with each other, ideal for collaborative problem-solving, debates, and consensus-building.\n",
    "- **Hierarchical**: Tree structure with parent-child relationships, ideal for layered processing, project management with task delegation, and multi-level review processes.\n",

    "\n",
    "### When to Use Each Topology:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Star Topology:**\n",
    "- Content creation with editorial oversight\n",
    "- Customer service with escalation paths\n",
    "- Research coordination with specialists\n",
    "- Centralized decision-making processes\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mesh Topology:**\n",
    "- Collaborative problem-solving\n",
    "- Consensus building and debates\n",
    "- Peer review processes\n",
    "- Democratic decision-making\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hierarchical Topology:**\n",
    "- Organizational structures\n",
    "- Multi-level review processes\n",
    "- Project management with delegation\n",
    "- Layered data processing\n",
    "\n",
    "### Best Practices:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Clear Role Definition**: Each agent should have a specific, well-defined role\n",
    "2. **Appropriate System Prompts**: Tailor prompts to the agent's expertise and position\n",
    "3. **Proper Cleanup**: Always stop networks when they're no longer needed\n",
    "4. **Status Monitoring**: Regularly check network status for debugging\n",
    "5. **Strategic Communication**: Use targeted messaging for specific agents\n",
    "6. **Resource Management**: Monitor active networks to avoid resource waste\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "You've now mastered the fundamentals of building multi-agent systems with Strands Agent Graph! You can create sophisticated networks of specialized AI agents that collaborate to solve complex problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key to successful multi-agent systems is:\n",
    "- Matching topology to use case\n",
    "- Defining clear agent roles and responsibilities  \n",
    "- Establishing proper communication patterns\n",
    "- Managing resources and cleanup effectively\n",
    "\n",
    "From here, you can build increasingly sophisticated systems for real-world applications in research, content creation, decision-making, customer service, and beyond."
