# Tools and Model Context Protocol (MCP)

This tutorial covers the two ways to give a Strands agent tools: writing your own custom tools, and connecting to external Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers. You define custom tools with the `@tool` decorator and the `TOOL_SPEC` dictionary, and connect to MCP servers over stdio and Streamable HTTP transports.

## Tutorial Details

| **Agent Pattern**      | Single agent                                             |
| **Tools**              | Custom tools (`@tool`, `TOOL_SPEC`), MCP tools |

## Key Concepts

- **Custom tools**: Define your own tools with the `@tool` decorator (a typed function plus a docstring) or with the `TOOL_SPEC` dictionary, which gives explicit control over the input schema and success or error results.
- **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**: An open protocol for connecting agents to external tool servers. The `MCPClient` connects over stdio or Streamable HTTP and exposes the server's tools, prompts, and resources.
- **Direct tool invocation**: Call a tool yourself with `agent.tool.<name>` without going through the model.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or higher
- An AWS account with credentials configured
- Access to Anthropic Claude Sonnet 4.5 (`us.anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929-v1:0`) on Amazon Bedrock (see [model access](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/model-access.html))
- Basic understanding of Python

| Path | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| [01-using-mcp-tools/mcp-agent.ipynb](./01-using-mcp-tools/mcp-agent.ipynb) | Connect an agent to MCP servers over stdio and Streamable HTTP, use multiple servers together, and invoke MCP tools directly |
| [02-custom-tools/custom-tools-with-strands-agents.ipynb](./02-custom-tools/custom-tools-with-strands-agents.ipynb) | Build custom tools with the `@tool` decorator and the `TOOL_SPEC` dictionary, handle tool errors, and inspect tool results |

## Getting Started

Each sub-sample is self-contained and has its own `requirements.txt`. Pick the one you want to run, install its dependencies, and open its notebook.

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   cd 01-using-mcp-tools        # or: cd 02-custom-tools
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run the notebook** in that folder and run the cells in order.

## Cleanup

The custom-tools notebook creates a local SQLite file (`appointments.db`) in its folder; delete it to reset. No persistent AWS resources are created.
