    "# Evaluating Strands Agent with Datadog LLM Observability and RAGAS Evaluations\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "In this example we will demonstrate how to build an agent with observability and evaluation. We will leverage [Datadog](https://datadoghq.com/) to process the Strands Agent traces along with metrics to evaluate the performance. The primary focus is on agent evaluation, using the traces produced by the SDK to observe the quality of responses generated. \n",
    "\n",
    "Strands Agents have build-in support for observability with Datadog. In this notebook, we demonstrate how to integrate Datadog, collect the data, configure Datadog Ragas Evaluations, and finally associate the scores back to the traces. Having the traces and the scores in one place allows for deeper dives, trend analysis, and continous improvement.\n",
